# Machine-Learning-Classification

Unlike regression where you predict a continuous number, you use classification to predict a category. There is a wide variety of classification applications from medicine to marketing.

Types of Classification:

  i) Logistic Regression

 ii) K-Nearest Neighbour(K-NN)

iii) Support Vector Machine(SVM)

 iv) Naive Bayes

  v) Decision Tree Classification

 vi) Random Forest Classification


## Logistic Regression: 
Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary).  Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.  Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables
