# Machine-Learning-Classification
## Do we need any feature extraction of image to train Deep neural network for image classifications?

- The biggest advantage of Deep Learning is that we do not need to manually extract features from the image. The network learns to extract features while training. You just feed the image to the network (pixel values)

-  choose a standard architecture such as VGG, GoogleNet or ResNet

1. Input Image >> Feature Selections >> Classifier >> Result [Traditional ML]
2. Input Image >> Neural Network >> Result [Deep Learning]

- the major difference between ML and DL algorithms is that for ML you have to create your own feature vector, while for DL algorithms they extract features automatically in convolution layers.

Unlike regression where you predict a continuous number, you use classification to predict a category. There is a wide variety of classification applications from medicine to marketing....

Types of Classification:

  i) Logistic Regression

 ii) K-Nearest Neighbour(K-NN)

iii) Support Vector Machine(SVM)

 iv) Naive Bayes

  v) Decision Tree Classification

 vi) Random Forest Classification


## Logistic Regression: 
Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary).  Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.  Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.
